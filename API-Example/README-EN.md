ApsaraVideo Player SDK Android Sample Project

## **📖 Project Overview**

This project is an Android sample project for the ApsaraVideo Player SDK, written in Java, designed to help developers quickly understand and integrate the core functionalities provided by the SDK.

The project adopts a **modular architecture design**, supports schema-based routing navigation, and offers excellent **extensibility** and **maintainability**.

## **✨ Feature Highlights**

### **🎯 Single-Function Demonstration Design**

- **Focus on single feature** – Each module demonstrates only one core function, making it easy to understand and verify.
- **Minimal code implementation** – Only core logic is retained, eliminating redundant code and improving example readability.
- **Unified access entry** – Supports schema-based navigation between modules, enabling decoupled module communication.

### **🔧 Technical Features**

- **Modular architecture** – Each functional module is independently encapsulated for easier management and reuse.
- **Non-invasive routing mechanism** – Implements schema navigation based on Android Intent, without requiring additional frameworks.
- **Material Design style** – Follows Material Design guidelines to ensure visual consistency.
- **Internationalization support** – Supports automatic switching between Chinese and English for multi-language environments.
- **Configuration-driven** – Supports both XML and code-based configuration methods.

## **🔐 License Configuration Instructions**

This project does not include an official license. Please complete the following steps to configure it before using all features.

### ✅ Preparations for Production Use

1. **Obtain and Integrate the License**

   Please refer to the [Bind a license](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/apsara-video-sdk/user-guide/access-to-license) documentation to obtain an authorized Player SDK License and follow the instructions to complete the integration.

2. **Update License Information**

   In the `App/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file, locate the following fields and replace them with your own License:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.aliyun.alivc_license.licensekey"
    android:value="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />
<meta-data
    android:name="com.aliyun.alivc_license.licensefile"
    android:value="YOUR_LICENSE_FILE_PATH" />
```

* license key: Enter the License key string obtained from the console.

* license file: Specify the path to the License file, e.g., assets/cert/release.crt.

3. **Rebuild and Run the Project**

After completing the configuration, please rebuild and run the project. The SDK will automatically load the license and enable full functionality.
