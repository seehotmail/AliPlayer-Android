# amdemos-android-player

A demo project for Apsara Video Player SDK.

## **🔐 License Configuration Instructions**

This project does not include an official license. Please complete the following steps to configure it before using all features.

### ✅ Preparations for Production Use

1. **Obtain and Integrate the License**

   Please refer to the [Bind a license](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/apsara-video-sdk/user-guide/access-to-license) documentation to obtain an authorized Player SDK License and follow the instructions to complete the integration.

2. **Update License Information**

   In the `AUIPlayerAPP/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file, locate the following fields and replace them with your own License:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.aliyun.alivc_license.licensekey"
    android:value="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />
<meta-data
    android:name="com.aliyun.alivc_license.licensefile"
    android:value="YOUR_LICENSE_FILE_PATH" />
```

* license key: Enter the License key string obtained from the console.

* license file: Specify the path to the License file, e.g., assets/cert/release.crt.

3. **Rebuild and Run the Project**

After completing the configuration, please rebuild and run the project. The SDK will automatically load the license and enable full functionality.

> **⚠️ Note**: If the license is not configured correctly, the player functionality may be limited
> or unavailable.

## **🚀 Quick Start**

### **🧰 Environment Requirements**

| Tool           | Version Requirement  |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Android Studio | 4.0+                 |
| Android SDK    | API 21+              |
| JDK            | Recommended: 8 or 11 |

**⚠️ Note:** The current Gradle version **does not support JDK 17 or higher**.

If you have JDK 17, 21, 23, or later installed, please switch to JDK 8 or 11 before building the project.

> **How to set JDK 11:**
>
> In Android Studio, go to `Settings` (
> or `Preferences`) → `Build, Execution, Deployment` → `Build Tools` → `Gradle` → `Gradle JDK`, and
> select 11. (If JDK 11 is not available, please upgrade Android Studio.)

### **IDE**

* Android Studio

### **📦 Build and Run**

The current player demo project has undergone structural improvements to support both all-in-one and standalone compilation, enhancing development efficiency.

1. **Independent Compilation (Recommended)**

   * ou need to copy the basic module AndroidThirdParty from the AlivcAIODemo project to the current directory.
   * Open and run the project with Android Studio using the current directory as the target folder to achieve standalone compilation of the player module.

2. **Integrated Compilation**

   * The current project is embedded within the AlivcAIODemo project.
   * You can directly open and run AlivcAIODemo with Android Studio to achieve multi-module compilation.

3. **Environment Configuration**
   * Open Android Studio, go to Settings (or Preferences) → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle → Gradle JDK, select 11 (if 11 is not available, please upgrade Android Studio).

4. **Sync the Project**
   * Android Studio will automatically prompt to sync Gradle.
   * Click `Sync Now` and wait for the synchronization to complete.

5. **Connect Device and Run**
   * Connect an **Android physical** device via USB and ensure that Developer Mode and USB Debugging permissions are enabled.
   * Click the `Run` button (green triangle) on the toolbar.
   * Select the target device and wait for the application to install and run.

### **🧪 Verification Results**

After the application starts, it will enter the main functionality menu page. 
Click any functionality item to jump to the corresponding playback demonstration page.

### **Compilation Configuration**

1. If you are using**All-in-one Compilation**, the underlying SDK utilizes the Audio-Video Terminal SDK (AliVCSDK).
2. If you are using**Standalone Compilation**, you can configure the underlying SDK to use either the player SDK (AliyunPlayer) or the Audio-Video Terminal SDK.
   1. The `allInOne` compilation configuration in the `gradle.properties` file, determines the SDK type used.
   2. true, uses the Audio-Video Terminal SDK; false, uses the player SDK.

## **SDK Integration**

* [SDK download](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/vod/developer-reference/sdk-download)
* [Quick integration](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/vod/developer-reference/quick-integration-1)

**Note: If you integrate both the live streaming push SDK and the player SDK, there will be conflict issues. You can use the [Apsara Video SDK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/apsara-video-sdk/download-sdks) to avoid conflicts.**
